# Roomz (Name change pending)

LAN-synchronized single-stream audio playback: one global stream, all devices in sync. Like an old school radio!

- **Single global stream** — no rooms, no codes. One playlist and one playback state for the entire LAN.
- **Sub-10 ms sync** on LAN using NTP-style clock sync and Web Audio API.
- **Per-device delay** (0–500 ms) to compensate for speaker placement.
- **Multiple library folders** — add paths from the UI (under an allowed base); scan recursively. Upload to a chosen folder.
- Upload or scan, collaborative playlist, simple chat.


## The Why

I created Roomz because I was annoyed that I cannot connect more than 1 BT Speaker to my phone for wider 'covarage'. 

Now I can play music throughout my house from multiple devices.

I'm pretty sure something else already exists for this. . . but so-what.

### Future plans:
- Add a centralized control, for managing per device delays and volume from one client.
- Create a client for rpi or headless devices.
- Maybe add a 'Announcement' function to the 'Main' client, to broadcast voice over the stream.

### Warning

Roomz is meant to be run on a private LAN/Home network. There is no security built in, and anybody connected to the network has full access. If enough interest is shown for it, then security might be added at a later date.

## Run

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open `http://<this-machine-ip>:8000` in a browser.

## Development

Install with dev dependencies (pytest, ruff, black), then run tests and lint:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run black --check .   # optional
```

## Multi-device sync test

1. Run the server on a machine on your LAN (e.g. `192.168.1.10`).
2. On multiple devices (phones, laptops, same LAN), open `http://192.168.1.10:8000`.
3. Add or scan music, press play. All clients should play the same track at the same position.
4. Use **Speaker delay (ms)** on each device to align with physical speaker placement (e.g. farther speakers get more delay).

## Adding music

- **Library folders**: In **Library folders**, add a path (and optional name). Paths must be under the allowed base (default: project `data/`; set `ROOMZ_LIBRARY_BASE` to allow e.g. `/home/you/Music`). Remove a folder only when it has no tracks.
- **Upload**: Choose a destination folder in the **Upload to** dropdown, then **Upload** and select MP3/WAV/OGG/M4A/FLAC files. They are saved under that folder and added to the playlist.
- **Scan**: **Scan all** scans every library folder recursively; or click **Scan** next to a folder to scan only that one. New files are added to the DB and playlist.

## Per-device delay

Use the **Speaker delay compensation (ms)** slider (0–500) in the header to fine-tune each device. No server round-trip; applies instantly to the sync position so playback stays aligned with others.

## Sync accuracy

On a typical LAN, sync within **&lt;10 ms** is achievable with Web Audio API and clock sync. Browser and device output latency can add a constant offset; use the delay slider to compensate so all speakers sound in phase.

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Alembic, SQLite, mutagen, aiofiles. Managed with **uv**.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, layered vanilla CSS (reset, base, colors, layout, components), Web Audio API (with &lt;audio&gt; fallback).

No auth (LAN-only). Production run: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
