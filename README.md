# Roomz
Self Hosted Music streaming server
- Plays your locally hosted music
- Create different streams, with multiple clients per stream
- Webapp frontend for clients
- Sync clients to stream(adjustable timed sync)
- Creates playlist(Radio like) based on selected album/artist(LastFM), using available hosted music
- Suggest artists not in library, based on current song

Potential ideas:
- Server/client side equalizer
- Indirect volume control/client control
- Lidarr connection for automated downloads
- CLI based app for SBC slaves/clients
